1) print hello after 3 to 17. so it would print it 14 times.

2)The range is 12, % means modulo, so 12 divided by 3 will give 4. It will print hello 4 times.

3)Considering that both are will print 3 hellos, then total would be 6 hellos.

4)I would say it would print hello 3 times, because 0 + 3.

5)First will print 7 and adding 1 more will give 8 "hello".

What does the fooXX do?) do not understand.
